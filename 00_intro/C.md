# Read the docs!

It's unrealistic to expect anyone to memorize how every function works and never forget.
Instead, knowing what to search is half the battle. 

## Checking docs online
Docs for [base `R`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/00Index.html)

Docs specific to [`data.table`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/data.table/versions/1.14.8)

And you can always check directly within `R` by preceeding a function with `?`
```
# Open docs for the fread function
?fread
```
