# Read the docs!

If ever a function is unclear, or even if you think it *is* clear, the first place to go is the documentation.

Know that it's unrealistic to expect anyone to memorize how every function works and never forget.

You can always check directly within `R` by preceeding a function with `?`
```
?writeLines

?rle
```
