# Introduction

## About me
Hi! I'm Cory (he/him), a bioinformatician working for Data Tecnica International (DTi) at CARD on the NIH main campus. Broadly, my role is to develop or implement accessible and reproducible scientific analysis pipelines. I work with large-scale DNA, RNA and proteomics data, focused on the Linux HPC environment (e.g. Biowulf) using bash, R and python. I recently transitioned from my postdoc with NHGRI on the NIH main campus, where I worked on developing and testing massively parallel CRISPR variant engineering in humanized yeast. Prior to that, my PhD work was with the Bergland lab at UVA, where I developed a pipeline for taking extremely low amounts of DNA sequencing data and predicting whole genome sequences (in recombinant Drosophila populations). While at UVA, I developed and taught an introductory bioinformatics class for students with no prior experience with the command-line.

## About this class

There you are, finished with recording results and generating reports for your most recent experiment. But alas! The data is spread across multiple sources with different formatting and file types. What we need is some data wrangling: the process of preparing data such that it's combined, organized and formatted before downstream use (like running statistical tests or making figures). We'll cover various tips and tricks for wrangling data, with an emphasis on the syntax of the handy R packages data.table and foreach. We'll cover topics such as

* Input and output operations, like importing data and writing output, including and combining multiple files into a single table
* How to reshape between 'long' and 'wide' data, and when to use which
* Subsetting, filtering, binning and merging data
* Splitting text in one column into multiple columns
* How to use aggregate functions for calculating new values from the raw data
 

To get through everything in time, things will move quickly! The material will be presented in a tutorial format as I go over the various syntax and commands related to the above skills. You are encouraged to work through this repository containing README docs and code examples to practice things more intently and at your own pace. The repository can serve as a resource to go back and recall how to apply the skills to your own work.
