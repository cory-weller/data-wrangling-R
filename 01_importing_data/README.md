# Importing data

The first step of working with data in `R` is loading it into your environment. Often, we need to import plain text data. This is in contrast to more complex objects that have hierarchical structure or must be converted to text.

Typically, if you can read it, it's text. Examples of text are plain `.txt`, `.csv` or `.tsv` files.

Excel files are *not* plain text, in addition to being a presumptive program that likes to convert gene names into DATE format.

For best practices, work with plain text if possible. Excel can save files as tab-separated or comma-separated text.
