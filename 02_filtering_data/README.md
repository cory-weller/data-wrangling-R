# Filtering data

Here, we're referring to filtering in the sense of inclusion or exclusion of rows based on some criteria. This includes operations like 
* removing rows where a certain column is NA
* only including rows where a certain column value is above a threshold
* subsetting data to only include a desired set of values
* splitting a table into two based on column contents
