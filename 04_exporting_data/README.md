# Exporting Data

Exporting data is simply the counterpart to importing it, creating a
permanent snapshot of your work on the computer's disk.

It's often wise to save intermediate or fully-processed data sets.
Doing so can mean you don't need to re-run extensive analyses over
again, saving time (and the possibility that something goes wrong).
